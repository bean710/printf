.TH _PRINTF "3" "COHORT 10" "HOLBERTON" "*** How To Use _printf ***"
.SH NAME
_printf - format and print data to standard output.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include "holberton.h"\fR
.PP
\fBint _printf(const char *\fR\fIformat\fR\fB, ...);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fB_printf\fR() function prints to standard output according to a
\fIformat\fR as described below.
.SS Return Value
The \fB_printf\fR() function returns the number of characters it has printed.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, and must be the first argument
passed to the \fB_printf\fR() function.
It will print ordinary characters (not %) without changing them to standard output.
It will also print a variety of data, passed as additional arguments after the format string.
.SS Conversion Specifiers
These characters will tell \fB_printf\fR() what type of conversion is needed.
.br
Here are their meanings:
.PP
\fBd, i\fR   This specifier will print an argument of type INT.
.PP
\fBs\fR      This specifier will print an argument of type CHAR *.
.PP
\fBu\fR      This specifier will print an argument of type UNSIGNED INT.
.PP
\fBc\fR      This specifier will print an argument of type CHAR.
.PP
\fBo\fR      This specifier will print an UNSIGNED INT in octal.
.PP
\fBx\fR      This specifier will print an UNSIGNED INT in hexadecimal.
.PP
\fBX\fR      This specifier will print an UNSIGNED INT in uppercase hex.
.PP
\fBr\fR      This specifier will print a CHAR * in reverse.
.PP
\fBR\fR      This specifier will print a CHAR * in ROT13 format.
.PP
\fBS\fR      This specifier will print a string, including the special char.
.SS Long and Short Integers
For each argument type that is an integer, \fB_printf\fR() will print them.
If the integers are long or short, you must specify that.
All that needs be done is to prefix your int type (d, i, o, u, x, X) with:
.PP
\fBl\fR      For long types.
.PP
\fBh\fR      For short types.
